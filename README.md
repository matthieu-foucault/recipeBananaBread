# Banana bread

## Ingredients (in order of appearance)

* 100g of softened butter (leave it at room temperature for 2h, or 20 sec in the microwave.)
* 200g of sugar
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla sugar
* 2 eggs (from free range chicken if possible 🐔)
* 3 old bananas
* 200g of flour
* 65g of blended hazelnuts (try to keep small chunks of hazelnut, otherwise it will taste a bit floury)
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder

## Steps

* Preheat the oven to 180°C/356°F/453,15K
* Mix the softened butter, sugar and vanilla sugar together. Unless your butter is really soft, the best tool for that is either a potato masher, or your bare hands if you don't mind having greasy hands afterwards.
* Add the eggs and bananas that you have crushed with the potato masher, mix until you have a homogeneous preparation.
* Add the flour, hazelnuts, and baking powder; mix.
* Pour the mix in a buttered baking pan.
* Put it in the oven for about 35 minutes, and then check the cooking regularly by piercing through the bread with a knife. When the knife comes out almost clean, your banana bread is ready.
* [Next, you eat the banana!](https://youtu.be/U90dnUbZMmM) bread.
